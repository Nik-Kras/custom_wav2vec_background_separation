# custom_wav2vec_background_separation

The goal of this project is to gain practical experience with the development and training of networks such as wav2vec. It also serves as a practical exercise to replicate the model described in the paper.

# Project Plan
1. Build wav2vec and train it for a noise contrastive binary classification task
2. Fine-tune wav2vec for background separation

The intermediate stages will include data synthesis and other stages of development.
